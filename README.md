## Abstract
The neural mechanisms of curiosity in humans are a prominent topic in the field, while rare studies uncover the underlying neural mechanisms associated with the process of curiosity and its relief. This study investigates the neural temporal course of curiosity, employing high-density EEG and a two-period blurred picture task to induce and alleviate curiosity in 40 participants. Participants' electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was recorded during the picture task, and the results indicate that the N170 in the central region and the P300 in the partial are modulated by different levels of curiosity. Both N170 and P300 amplitude correlated with surprise ratings, with P300 amplitude showing a correlation with subject-level anxiety. Our findings offer valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of curiosity within the human brain, shedding light on the cognitive processes and emotions involved in the induction and alleviation of curiosity.
